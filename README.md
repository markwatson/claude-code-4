# AI-Generated Todo App

This complete todo application was written entirely by Claude 4 Sonnet with zero human coding. The app features user authentication, persistent SQLite storage, responsive design, and smart task prioritization - all generated through natural language conversation.

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd server && npm install
   ```

2. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

3. **Start the frontend (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with the backend running on `http://localhost:5001`. The SQLite database is automatically created and managed in the server directory.
